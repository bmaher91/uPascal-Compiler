<h1>Design Tradeoffs</h1>

<h3>Error Handling</h3>
<p>
  Initially, we were planning on implementing error recovery such that if there were scan errors
  we would skip the lexeme and attempt to continue to scan for tokens and list out all scan errors
  found. The issue arose that it became difficult to know when to stop scanning and attempt scan
  recovery which would actually lead errors to be more difficult to read or lead to more errors than
  there actually were without implementing a comlex error handling strategy. Since the purpose of
  the error handling system was to handle errors effectively and with precision, the decision was
  made by the team to stop compiling and output errors the first time we see one. While this didn't
  allow for the programmer to get a full list of errors, it did allow for each error to be much
  more specific and made the process of debugging simpler for the programmer utilizing our compiler.
</p>

<h3>Test Suite</h3>
<p>
  Another design tradeoff that was made was our test suite. This was meant to be able to be run by
  us via a "--test" flag in our compiler in order to run unit tests instead of compiling. The main
  tradeoff here was time. In the beginning we implemented a set of thorough unit tests for the
  scanner that tested every FSA in various combinations that we believed led to a very full coverage
  of the correctness of our scanner. The same idea was to be implemented for the parser, but due to
  the time constraints of this project, it became necessary to halt further work on the unit test
  suite in favor of actually completing the compiler. We did end up having to fix several parser
  bugs that arose later which may have been found sooner had we incorporated the parser test suite
  as planned.
