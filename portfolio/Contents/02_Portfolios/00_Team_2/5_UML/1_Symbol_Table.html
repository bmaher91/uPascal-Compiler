<h1>UML</h1>
<p>
As noted elsewhere, a clear outline was given to all teams for the design and implementation of the
scanner, parser, and semantic analyzer. With approval, teams were allowed to vary their actual
designs and implmementations. The scanner was the only module that required UML ahead of time. That
is provided on this page along with the UML for the scanner as it actually was implemented.
</p>

<h2>Scanner UML (Before Coding)</h2>

<p>
  Our initial design for the Scanner was naive as it did not take into account a proper method for
  detecting and storing the list of lexemes and their associated tokens. Before programming the
  scanner, the idea was to have a distinct FSA for each group of tokens in the micro-Pascal
  language. This proved to be difficult as it required the dispatcher to look ahead more than a
  single character in order to more accurately decide which FSA to pass the character off to and
  would have required FSAs to backtrack and pass along the lexeme to another FSA mid-generation.
  This seemed messy and an ineffective way to handle the various FSAs. Eventually, the model was
  adapted to have each FSA responsible for handling one type of input (a digit, a letter, a symbol,
  etc).
